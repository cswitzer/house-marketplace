1. I learned how to configure a firebase database
2. I learned how to use React Router and the useNavigate hook
3. I learned how to use the Link tag; it can only be used in conjunction with the Router and Route tags
4. I learned that css fixed and absolute positions are similar, but that fixed is absolute positioning
   the browser window while absolute positioning is for the parent container
